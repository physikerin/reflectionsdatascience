    "<h1>P-Hacking and Multiple Comparisons Bias</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple comparisons bias is a pervasive problem in statistics, data science, and in general forecasting/predictions. The short explanation is that the more tests you run, the more likely you are to get an outcome that you want/expect. If you ignore the multitude of tests that failed, you are clearly setting yourself up for failure by misinterpreting what's going on in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly common example of this is when looking for relationships in large data sets comprising of many independent series or variables. In this case you run a test each time you evaluate whether a relationship exists between a set of variables."

    "\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT: p-values must be treated as binary.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A common mistake is that p-values are treated as more or less significant. This is bad practice as it allows for what's known as p-hacking and will result in more false positives than you expect. Effectively, you will be too likely to convince yourself that relationships exist in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To treat p-values as binary, a cutoff must be set in advance. Then the p-value must be compared with the cutoff and treated as significant/not signficant. Here we'll show this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Cutoff is our Significance Level</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can refer to the cutoff as our significance level because a lower cutoff means that results which pass it are significant at a higher level of confidence. So if you have a cutoff of 0.05, then even on random data 5% of tests will pass based on chance. A cutoff of 0.01 reduces this to 1%, which is a more stringent test. We can therefore have more confidence in our results."
